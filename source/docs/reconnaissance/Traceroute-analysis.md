# Traceroute analysis

Use traceroute to perform a detailed analysis of the network paths. The tool will ping each of the hops in the path a number of times to get an accurate measure of the stability and response times of each hop. When tracing the route to a specific IP address it will show which service provider the target is using and this may be helpful for determining a few basic things like country, state and sometimes more.
