## Notes

Cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust a user has in a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust a site has in a 
user's browser.

* Requests are not validated server-side
* Server does not check whether request was generated by user
* Requests can be forged and sent to users (to make the server data leakage, change a session state, or manipulate a user's account)

CSRF will be possible if the session relies only on cookies or on HTTP Basic Authentication header, and there are no 
unpredictable parameters on the request.
