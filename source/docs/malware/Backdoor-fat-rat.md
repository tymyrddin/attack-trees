## Notes

Also attempts to generate Undetectable Metasploit backdoors for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. FatRat uses encryption to bypass most of the Antivirus. It can be configured for system exploitation, post-exploitation 
attacks, browser attacks, DLL attacks, FUD payloads, etc.

* SearchSploit gives a list of payloads and backdoors for every type of target
* File Pumper increases size of a payload to increase stealth
