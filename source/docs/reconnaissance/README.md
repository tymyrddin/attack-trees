# Introduction

## What?

Although pentesting is by no means a linear process, reconnaissance is usually the first, most critical, and most time-consuming phase of any systematic (structured) hack.

Two types of reconnaissance are commonly used:

* An adversary uses publicly available information for guessing usernames of accounts and making organisational maps. Once usernames are known, adversaries can choose tools for gaining access.
* An adversary in a structured attack uses electronic reconnaissance to find where the resources are logically located, and to probe and scan the network for vulnerable hosts, applications, or infrastructure equipment.

## Why?

A reconnaissance attack is meant to gain as much information about the network as possible before launching other types of attacks. The most common and widely used hacking tools are reconnaissance tools. Many of these have been developed by hackers or network engineers to view problems on the network. 

Narrow the scope as much as possible:

* Who is the target?
* What is the target?
* Where is the target?
* When is the best time for an attack?
* How is the target defended and how to best attack?

## How?

Gather as much information as possible on the target by using public sources. Create a map of the network to determine what operating systems, applications, and address ranges are being used and to identify any accessible open ports.

* Gather information
* Discover associated websites, links, companies
* Associated people, names, emails, phone numbers, social networks, friends
* Associated social networking accounts


As security and intrusion detection have gotten more sophisticated, so have the reconnaissance tools created and used by adversaries and network engineers. The purpose of scanning during reconnaissance is to find what hosts are currently active on the network. With probing and adversary can gather additional information, such as the OS,, technologies used, other websites on the same server, DNS records, unlisted files, 
sub-domains, directories, neighbours, ...
