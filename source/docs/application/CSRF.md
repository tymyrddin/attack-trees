# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

## Attack tree

```text
1 Target user is logged in
2 Relevant action (POST request to change password or email, etc) (AND)
3 Forged code on hacking website (a form with POST method and hidden input field containing the new password)
4 Deliver 
    4.1 Autosubmit
    4.2 Social engineering
```

## Notes

Cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust a user has in a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust a site has in a 
user's browser.

* Requests are not validated server-side
* Server does not check whether request was generated by user
* Requests can be forged and sent to users (to make the server data leakage, change a session state, or manipulate a user's account)

CSRF will be possible if the session relies only on cookies or on HTTP Basic Authentication header, and there are no 
unpredictable parameters on the request.
