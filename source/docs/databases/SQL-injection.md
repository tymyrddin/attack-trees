# SQL injection

An SQL injection attack consists of insertion or “injection” of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data, plane input in order to effect the execution of predefined SQL commands. SQL Injection is often classified into three categories.

## In-band SQLi

In an in-band SQLi an attacker uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and gather results. The two most common types are:

* Error-based SQLi is a technique that captures error messages thrown by the database server to obtain information about the structure of the database. In some cases, error-based SQLi alone is enough to enumerate an entire database. While very useful during development, do disabled on a production site, or have the errors be logged to a file with restricted access.
* Union-based SQLi is a technique that leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result which is then returned as part of the HTTP response.

## Inferential SQLi

In an inferential SQLi attack, the database structure is reconstructed by sending payloads and observing the web application’s response and the resulting behaviour of the database server. No data is transferred via the web application and the attacker would not be able to see the result of an attack in-band, which is why such attacks are also called blind SQL Injection attacks.

* In Boolean-based SQLi an SQL query is sent to the database which forces the application to return a different result depending on whether the query returns a TRUE or FALSE result. The content within the HTTP response will change, or remain the same. A database can be enumerated character by character.
* In Time-based SQLi, likewise a query is sent to the database forcing it to wait for a specified amount of time (in seconds) before responding. The response time indicates whether the result of the query is TRUE or FALSE.

## Out-of-band SQLi

* Out-of-band SQLi can be used when it is not possible to use the same channel to launch the attack and gather results or if the server responses are not very stable, making an inferential time-based attack unreliable. This attack uses DNS or HTTP requests to deliver data.
