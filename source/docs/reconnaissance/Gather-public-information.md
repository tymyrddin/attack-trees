# Gather public information using search engines

* Use Search engines to understand what sensitive design and configuration information of the application/system/organisation is exposed both directly (on the organisation's website) or indirectly (on a third party website): 
  * Network diagrams and configurations
  * Archived posts and emails by administrators and other key staff
  * Log on procedures and username formats
  * Usernames and passwords
  * Error message content
  * Development, test, UAT and staging versions of the website
* Learn more about the organisation and people on finder sites and check public records
