# Research public information

Gather as much information as possible on the target by using public sources.

* Use Search engines to understand what sensitive design and configuration information of the application/system/organisation is exposed both directly (on the organisation's website) or indirectly (on a third party website): 
  * Network diagrams and configurations
  * Archived posts and emails by administrators and other key staff
  * Log on procedures and username formats
  * Usernames and passwords
  * Error message content
  * Development, test, UAT and staging versions of the website
* Learn more about the organisation and people on finder sites and check public records
* Domain Naming Systems (DNS) is another publicly available system that can provide a wealth of information regarding the IP addressing and naming strategies of virtually any organisation or company connected to the Internet.
