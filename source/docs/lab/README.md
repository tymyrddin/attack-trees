# Introduction

## What?

Set up and maintain a local testing lab

## Why?

Provide a convenient way to test new pentesting skills and software, hone skills while staying out of legal trouble, 
to guarantee that the effects of the testing are limited to the lab hardware and software, and to be able to 
mimic a specific environment and then pentest the copy, 

## How?

* Use virtualisation and containerisation.
