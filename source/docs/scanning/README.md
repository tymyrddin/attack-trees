# Introduction

## What?

Gather information about what ports (and services) target devices offer, including OS (or firmware version) of the target devices.

## Why?

Intelligently select tools and exploitation methods for an attack, scanning and enumeration can be used to make sure you:

* Attack only agreed-upon targets
* Get as much information as possible before increasing depth of attack
* Identify purpose and type of targets (what services are provided)
* Have specific information about versions of services running on target systems
* Categorise target systems

## How?

Attempt to find open ports on the target system. Key are the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) (and the available TCP flags).

* Locate network range
* Discover active machines
* Determine operating systems
* Define running services
* Map the network
