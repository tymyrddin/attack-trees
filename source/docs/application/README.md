# Introduction

## What?

Hacking software and programs on a (web) server.

## Why?

* Gaining ability to execute arbitrary code.
* Gaining privileged access.
* Gaining unauthorised data access.
* Create denial of service conditions.

## How?

Use weaknesses in software and programs, such as:

* Buffer overflow
* Lack of input validation
* Insecure configuration of permissions
* Insecure network connections
* Weak authentication

## Notes on mitigations

Spoofing and session hijacking:

* Use Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), HTTP Secure (HTTPS) and other secure communications protocols that encrypt data before it is sent and authenticate data as it is received.
* Use additional multi-step authentication methods.
