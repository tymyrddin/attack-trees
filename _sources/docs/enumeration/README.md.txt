# Introduction

## What?

Enumeration is listing and identifying the specific services and resources that a target offers.

## Why?

Move further and deeper into the scanning process to include security scanning. Enumeration is particularly successful in networks that contain unprotected network resources and services:

* Network services that are running but not in use.
* Default user accounts that have no passwords.
* User accounts that have a revealed password.
* Guest accounts that are active.

## How?

Take information already gathered during reconnaissance (like IP addresses) and during scanning (open ports) and gather as much data about the targets and services running on the targets, using a variety of techniques and tools.

1. Start with an IP address range or a specific DNS entry, and the open ports on the system. 
1. Use a number of methods to collect information on applications and hosts on the network and on the user accounts used on the network. 
1. Make a list of known and reachable services from that source.
