4 Make simple trojan (AND)
    4.1 Embed evil code in an executable package

## Notes

### Evade execute protections
Problems: Executables donâ€™t run by double click and users have to manually change file permission to executable.

Solution :
* Embed evil code in an executable package.
* Use a legitimate app to make the trojan less suspicious.
* One that runs by doubleclicking with root (admin) privileges.

### Creating An Android Trojan

* Embed a backdoor in a normal app.
* Everybody makes apps these days.
* Pretend to be a friend and send the app to the target.
* When the app is executed, the user will see a functional app but at the same time our backdoor will run in the background.
