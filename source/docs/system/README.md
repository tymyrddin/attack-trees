# Introduction

## What?

Gaining access to the host and its files (but the ultimate target is the user).

## Why?

To gain elevated privileges in order to be able to take action, like install software, get user data that can possibly give access to other sites or systems, destroy or alter audit trails to hide tracks of having been there, etc.

## How?

* Exploiting vulnerabilities (not always effective).
* Authenticating with credentials (effective).
