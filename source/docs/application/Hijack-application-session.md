# Hijack session (application)

A web server needs a method to recognize every userâ€™s connections. The most useful method depends on a token that the Web Server sends to the client browser after a successful client authentication. A session token is composed of a string of variable width and can be used in different ways, like in the URL, in the header of the http requisition as a cookie, in other parts of the header of the http request, or in the body of the http requisition.
