# Undesired HTTPS redirects

Being sent to the `https` version of a site is a major annoyance in local development when coding in a non-secure environment is required. This can happen for various reasons.

* Site is cached
* When spoofing, user on target machine is logged into the site
* Browser forces https

The automatic redirect to `https` in browsers can be fixed, as long as the site is not [correctly configured for HSTS](hsts). In general, check that:

* Extensions like "https everywhere" are turned off.
* Cache is cleared.
* History is cleared.

Note that when a browser always redirects local sites you own and you accessed before with `http` to `https`, we know for sure it is not a HSTS issue. This classifies as a bug in the browser.

## Google chrome and chromium

Go to Chrome -> Settings -> Privacy and security and and clear browsing data.

OR for a specific domain:

Go to View > Developer > Developer Tools > Application > Clear storage

And try again. if still not works, use `chrome://net-internals/#hsts`: Scroll down to "Delete domain security policies", enter the root domain that's causing the issue, and click the Delete button.

## Firefox

Go to Preferences -> Privacy -> Click 'Clear your history' -> When the pop-up appears, click Details -> Untick everything except 'Sites Preferences' -> Select 'Everything' in the select box at the top -> Click Ok

And try again. If not works, change the following setting in `about:config`:

```
network.stricttransportsecurity.preloadlist False
```

If still not works, set:

```
browser.fixup.fallback-to-https False
```

Maybe even:

```
browser.urlbar.autoFill False
```
