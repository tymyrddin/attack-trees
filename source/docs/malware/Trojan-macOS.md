## Notes

Problems: Executables donâ€™t run by double clickand users have to manually change file permission to executable.

Solution :
* Embed evil code in an executable package.
* Use a legitimate app to make the trojan less suspicious.
* One that runs by doubleclicking with root (admin) privileges.
