# Modifying backdoor source to bypass AV

## Attack tree

```text
1 Code is detected (OR)
    1.1 Use a different payload (OR)
    1.2 Change payload settings (OR)
    1.3 Change source code
        3.1 Text editor (OR)
            3.1.1 It is not the shellcode itself (AND)
            3.1.2 Removed/modified detectable code
                3.1.2.1 Identified what triggers AV programs by playing with the params and formats 
        3.2 Hex editor 
            3.2.1 Modified hex values
                3.2.1.1 Identified what triggers AV programs by changing values that do not affect code execution
2 Code is undetected
```

## Notes

Whether delivering a payload through an application vulnerability exploit, or through social engineering, running code 
on target machines is part of most penetration testing. That means bypassing antivirus software or other host-based 
protections.

AV programs use database of signatures to detect malware. Modifying backdoor code will change its signature.

* Open backdoor with text editor.
* Make sure shellcode is not detected, if it is then change payload settings or use a different one.
* Remove all arguments, add them one by one to identify the one triggering AV programs
* Remove/modify detectable code.

Some parts of the code may be doing nothing:

* Open file with hex editor.
* Change values that donâ€™t affect code execution.
* Save and test the file.

Note that creating a new payload or shellcode that creates a new signature that is not present in the antivirus' tools 
database can still be effective but falls short on the new solutions that base their detection on heuristics 
and behavioural analysis. Learn to write your own payloads in python from scratch, in which case:

* Don't develop for avoiding all AV. Include finding out what protections the target uses in reconnaisance.
* Keep it as simple as possible.
