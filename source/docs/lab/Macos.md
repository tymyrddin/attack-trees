## Using VMWare

MacOS can be installed on a VMware VM running on ESXi. This can be done after the preparation of a bootable installation image of the ISO format with hdiutil, applying a free patch on an ESXi server and configuring certain VM settings.

## Notes

Installing OS X in a virtual machine is not illegal, but unless you’re using a Mac, it is against Apple’s EULA. Most virtual machine software will try to stop you from installing OS X in a VM unless you’re on a Mac. 

A macOS VM is called a Hackintosh. According to Apple, Hackintosh computers are illegal, per the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and creating a Hackintosh computer violates Apple’s end-user license agreement (EULA) for any operating system in the OS X family. But, Apple doesn’t care about stopping Hackintosh as much as they do jailbreaking, because jailbreaking requires that the iOS system be exploited to gain root privileges, these exploits allow for arbitrary code execution with root.
